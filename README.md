Conda Buildpack
===============

This is a [Heroku Buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) for [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/), the Python distribution for scientific computing by Continuum Analytics.

We use Python 3 with Miniconda3. 

This buildpack enables the installation of binary packages through the
open source [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/) application.  Conda is
recognized as being core to Continuum's Anaconda Scientific Python distro
but it's also at the heart of the lighter weight
[Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) distro which we use
here to install _only_ the binary packages we need for our apps deployed
on Heroku.

To control what binary packages are installed by conda, supply a
`conda-requirements.txt` file (which can be created by capturing the output
of `conda list -e` for your working conda environment).
Like when using the standard buildpack for python from Heroku, you can also
still supply a `requirements.txt` file for [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip)
to process.  In this way, you can install binary packages via conda for
everything you can and still use pip for anything you can't.
Usage
-----

You can add it to upcoming builds of an existing application:

```console
$ heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/puhach/conda-buildpack.git -a [app-name]
```


## Warning

Heroku limits the final application footprint (slug) size to 300MB. Start small. In case the slug size limit is exceeded, deleting the build cache through the [heroku-repo plugin](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo#purge_cache) might help.

## Tip
This buildpack will result in a large slug size upon first deployment to heroku app (~300MB). Resulting builds will be much smaller (~100MB). One solution to the slug size problem is adding a large (even if it's critical) directory in .slugignore, pushing the app to heroku, then removing the directory from git ignore, then pushing again.
